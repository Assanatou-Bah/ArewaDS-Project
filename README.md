## Project Title - Rolling Dice with Plotly

## Overview

The Rolling Dice Project is a Python-based program that uses a class to model the rolling of dice and visualizes the outcomes using Plotly. It combines object-oriented programming principles with data visualization to provide an interactive and engaging experience for analyzing dice roll patterns.

## Features

**Class-Based Design:** 
Uses a Dice class to handle the logic for rolling dice.

**Interactive Visualizations:** 
Results of dice rolls are plotted using Plotly for a clear and intuitive representation.

**Customizable:**

Choose the number of dice to roll.

Define the number of sides for the dice.

**Supports Multiple Rolls:** 
Roll the dice multiple times and view the trends or distributions of the results.

## Technologies Used

**Python:** Core programming language for the implementation.

**Plotly:** For creating interactive plots and visualizations.


## Outputs and Visualizations

**Results Table:** View the outcome of each roll.

**Visualization:** Interactive Plotly plots such as:

Bar graphs to display the count of each result.
Histograms to show the frequency distribution of results.



## Example Use Case

Simulate dice rolls for tabletop games.

Analyze probabilities and distributions of outcomes for different dice configurations.

Visualize patterns in repeated rolls to aid in statistical studies.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher.

Plotly library.

Jupyter Notebook (if using the .ipynb file).
